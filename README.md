## About Locher 
```Did you know that Locher is the german term for an office tool that makes organizing printed media a breeze?```  
I am currently studying IT subjects at a university and working part-time at an agency which specializes in e-commerce and internet presence. Due to my nature of being easily excited by new tech flavors, my endeavors are often stretched far and thin. My presence on Github is just due to another spontaneous impulse because I liked the idea of deploying my work space with little to no overhead on various environments.

## Past involvements
```Did you know that Locher is so unspeakable that I long since accepted its pronunciation to be akin to Locker (/ˈlɑːkər/)?```
